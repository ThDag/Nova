# Alice

## Overview

Generally, a chatbot is the software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat. Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their questions.

Alice is an AI-powered psychological chatbot, specifically developed to understand people.

One function of Alice makes it really outstanding â€“ it will be able to understand and process human language when it comes to describing personality. So, if you ask the bot questions about yourself, it can make some predictions on your personality traits.

Another function of Alice is it is a chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnose people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to their location, or provide advice and support to the user depending on the situation they're in. I'm looking to make Alice able to make phone calls when necessary and also maybe adding augmented reality to make it seem like you're talking to an actual person through your phone or VR goggles.
