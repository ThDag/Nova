# Overview
Cree is a chatbot i'm developing for psychological evaluations. This chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnoze people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to them, or provide advice and support to the user. I'm looking to make cree able to make phone calls ehen neccessary and also maybe adding augumented reality to make it seem through your phone or VR goggles, like youre talking to an actual person.
