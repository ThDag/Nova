# Alice

## Overview

Alice is a conversational chatbot i'm developing for psychological evaluations. This chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnose people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to their location, or provide advice and support to the user depending on the situation they're in. I'm looking to make Alice able to make phone calls when neccessary and also maybe adding augumented reality to make it seem like you're talking to an actual person through your phone or VR goggles.

## Extended Description:

### Objectives:
In our research team i am currently developing a conversational chatbot with the purpose of conducting an initial psychological assessment interview. With this project, i intend to create a conversational bot with guarantees and scientific rigor that will help in psychological assessment work. In addition, once the tool has been built, it will be possible to study the differences between the interviews in which the user interacts with a chatbot (human-chatbot process) and the interviews in which the user interacts with a human psychologist (human-human process). This will allow us not only to improve the chatbot, but also to understand in depth what forms of interaction are most effective in achieving a certain objective. Furthermore, it will serve to establish the basis for the development of future tools, as well as to initiate a debate about the relevance and the necessary regulation of their use.
##
Psychology defines personality as a set of patterns visible in thinking, feeling, and behaving that distinguish an individual from others. The personality represents itself through consistent and repeatable behavior. 

## Advantages:
### Accessibility:
First of all, Alice is going to help relieve barriers associated with the stigma of accessing psychological health services and geographical barriers in face-to-face counseling. It will provide instant information 24/7 and serve exceptionally well for those working unconventional shifts.

Users enjoy the anonymity offered by chatbots, as they may be more likely to disclose sensitive information to a chatbot than to a human therapist (according to a recent study). Alice is also going to be built with personalised responses. Personalization is tailoring your communication and services to users' needs and characteristics. Itâ€™s a way to offer your target audience a unique experience that can increase their satisfaction. Alice will personalize the users behavior based on data collected about them, such as their demographics (age or nationality), interactions and many more.

### Cost Savings:
Alice will also offer cost savings in the form of travel expenses and telephone charges for patients. As for practitioners, they can focus on people in critical condition and work with health data uncovered by AI, which implies more efficiency.

### How It'll Work:
Before starting to create the chatbot, it is necessary to consider what type of virtual agent we want to program andfor what purpose. In my case, i will present the necessary elements to build a chatbot aimed at performing preliminary psychological assessment tasks, although it is true that the concepts and steps we will describe could be generalized to robots with similar functions.
