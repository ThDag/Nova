# Alice

# Overview
Alice is a conversational chatbot i'm developing for psychological evaluations. This chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnose people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to their location, or provide advice and support to the user depending on the situation they're in. I'm looking to make Alice able to make phone calls when neccessary and also maybe adding augumented reality to make it seem like you're talking to an actual person through your phone or VR goggles.
