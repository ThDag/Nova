# Alice

# Overview
Alice is a chatbot i'm developing for psychological evaluations. This chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnoze people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to them, or provide advice and support to the user. I'm looking to make Alice able to make phone calls when neccessary and also maybe adding augumented reality to make it seem like youre talking to an actual person through your phone or VR goggles,
