# Alice

## Overview

Alice is a conversational chatbot i'm developing for psychological evaluations. This chatbot will be able to evaluate, and diagnose people with psychological trauma and either encourage them to see the therapist closest to their location, or provide advice and support to the user depending on the situation they're in. I'm looking to make Alice able to make phone calls when neccessary and also maybe adding augumented reality to make it seem like you're talking to an actual person through your phone or VR goggles.

## Extended Description:

### Objectives;
In our research team i am currently designing a psychologist-chatbot that has the purpose of conducting an initial psychological assessment interview. With this project, we intend to create a conversational bot with guarantees and scientific rigor that will help in psychological assessment work. In addition, once the tool has been built, it will be possible to study the differences between the interviews in which the user interacts with a chatbot (human-chatbot process) and the interviews in which the user interacts with a human psychologist (human-human process). This will allow us not only to improve the chatbot, but also to understand in depth what forms of interaction are most effective in achieving a certain objective. Furthermore, it will serve to establish the basis for the development of future tools, as well as to initiate a debate about the relevance and the necessary regulation of their use.
